Learned
-

The students resported learing the following by doing the homework.

- Html and JS basics and syntax
- Use of MV.js functions for manipulation of vectors
- pixel scaling from html canvas to webgl coordinates"
- Use of basic mathematical concepts, like Linear interpolation, in the domain of WebGL and Computer Graphics.
- The need for mapping coordinates to the [-1,1] range for WebGL
- A thorough understanding of how to make the code scalable even with shorter length university assignments.
- Revision of vector algebra concepts.
- Debugging and writing code for the browser
- I learnt the properties of mapping, Color interpolation, and lerping, and the concepts of Canvas in WebGL.
- how to dynamically populate input fields, to connect js output to HTML, conflict resolution on Github, where we were accidentally replacing each other's code.
- I still have some problem creating a select menu through .innerHTML() command and I hope to learn it from RA in his hours
- realized similarities between JavaScript and Python. 
- learned about the concept of generalized affine combination (From wikipedia).
- Interpolation and its practicality in real life Computer Graphics applications.
- Sharing data between HTML and JS files

Improvement and other feedback
-

The students had the following comments about potential improvement and other aspects of the homework.

- A bit more explanation of the questions
- I would recommend if we could have achieved a computer generated graphic in this homework
- First assignment can be given on individual basis and  then after Add/Drop when teams are final, group assignments can be given.
- If you had clearly specified the process of user input and output, my teammate would not have wasted a lot of her time in aesthetics.
- It was a really fun homework, would be better if we had some help in learning the language from before hand
- It would be helpful to mention in the homework pdf if there are multiple approaches to achieve a certain outcome (which there usually are) and if all/some are acceptable, as is allowed. For example, the user input could be done through forms, or prompts etc. and students felt the need for it to be clarified which would be acceptable.
- Not sure. HTML is a bit weird and hard to control.
- Test cases can be provided.
- the homework was fine in my opinion, the workload was completely fine considering the due-date granted.
- Looking at MV.js was fun. There coding scheme was exceptional at handling irregular inputs and throwing exceptions.
